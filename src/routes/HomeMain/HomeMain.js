      <p>Don't worry, we don't have to go into it. You're well familiar with how much good food ends up in your trash. <span className='italic'>Why should an abundance of food mean an abundance of waste?</span></p>

      <h3>Yes... there's now an app for that.</h3>
      <p><span className='italic'>Fridg路u路Dare</span> (or 'FUD' for short) challenges food waste by keeping a micro-inventory for your food. Keep track of what you have to help you decide what you need (and feel better about throwing less food away). A win for the planet and a win for your pocket!</p>
